#define _GNU_SOURCE: This macro defines various GNU extensions to be made available. It is used to enable certain features and functions in the code.

The list of #include statements at the beginning of the code includes necessary header files that provide function prototypes and definitions for the functions and libraries used in the code.

backupSuidBinary function: This function takes the suid_binary parameter (the path to the SUID binary file) and creates a backup of it by executing a system command to copy the file to /tmp/bak.

madviseThread function: This is a thread function that takes a void* argument arg, representing the memory address of the shared memory page. It uses a loop to repeatedly call madvise system call on the memory page with the MADV_DONTNEED option. The purpose of this function is to trigger the race condition by causing frequent page cleaning.

patchSuidBinary function: This function takes the pid of the child process, a pointer map to the shared memory page, the shellcode array representing the payload, and the length of the shellcode. It uses nested loops to repeatedly call ptrace system call to modify the memory page with the shellcode. The purpose of this function is to modify the shared memory page with the payload, taking advantage of the race condition.

escalatePrivileges function: This function takes the suid_binary path, the shellcode array, and the length of the shellcode. It first opens the SUID binary file in read-only mode using the open system call and checks for any errors. Then it retrieves information about the file using fstat system call. Next, it uses mmap to map the file into memory, creating a shared memory page. If successful, it prints a message, backs up the SUID binary using the backupSuidBinary function, and forks a child process.

In the child process, a new thread is created using pthread_create to execute the madviseThread function. Then, the ptrace system call with PTRACE_TRACEME is called, and the process is stopped using SIGSTOP signal to allow the parent process to trace it. The child process waits for the thread to complete using pthread_join.

In the parent process, it waits for the child process to complete using waitpid. Once the child process has finished, it calls the patchSuidBinary function to modify the shared memory page with the shellcode.

After the modification is complete, the shared memory is unmapped using munmap, and the file descriptor is closed using close.

main function: This is the entry point of the program. It defines the suid_binary path and the shellcode array containing the payload. It calls the escalatePrivileges function, passing the necessary parameters.

Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution.
